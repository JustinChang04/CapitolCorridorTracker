A React Native-based app to track the timeliness of Capitol Corridor trains running between San Jose/Oakland and Sacramento/Auburn.

The app allows the user to input a train number, and then if it's a valid train number at the time, it will fetch all of the stations (origin station at the top, destination station at the bottom) and display them. A color indicator on the right indicates the timeliness of the train.

Green indicates that the train is on time. Yellow indicates that the train is at most 15 minutes late. Red indicates that the train is over 15 minutes late. Blue indicates that the train is early.

This project is still a work-in-progress. More features and debugging to come.
